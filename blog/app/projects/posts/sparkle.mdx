## Overview

The **Sparkle Witch Game** is an object-oriented Java simulation that creates an engaging, dynamic world populated by various entities. The system responds to user input in real time, introducing world-changing events and transformations as the game progresses. Developed between **May 2024** and **June 2024**, this project emphasizes interactive storytelling and procedurally generated behavior, all powered by core Java functionalities.

## Key Features

### Object-Oriented Design
- **Entity-Based Architecture**: Each character (Witch, Sparkle, etc.) is its own class, enabling unique methods and behaviors.
- **Randomization**: Leveraged `java.util.Random` for generating unpredictable gameplay events such as determining whether an entity becomes a sparkle or poison.

### Interactive Environment
- **Real-Time Transformations**: Clicking on different tiles or entities triggers environment changes (e.g., grass turning barren, mushrooms spawning).
- **Custom Animations**: Java-based animations for witches, sparkles, and other entities enhance immersion, showcasing items like the Witchâ€™s broom blowing in the wind.

### Entities and Behaviors

#### Entity 1: Witch
- Moves toward **mushrooms** and **stumps**, transforming them randomly into **sparkle** or **poison**.
- Carries a broom and has hair animations that respond to movement and wind-like effects.
  
#### Entity 2: Sparkle
- **Exponential Spread**: Sparkles replicate nearby, and in some cases spawn poison, creating a chain reaction that continuously evolves the game map.

### World-Changing Event
- **Grass Transformation**: Clicking on a free grass tile depletes the surrounding grass (unless occupied by an entity) into **barren land** and **burnt mushrooms**.
- **Fairy to Witch**: Clicking on a fairy turns it into a witch, prompting a new cycle of transformations (turning stumps and mushrooms into sparkles or poison).

### Instance Variable
- **Color**  
  - Determines if a stump or mushroom transforms into **poison** or **sparkle**, selected at random using `java.util.Random`.
  - Implemented as a `double` type. If the randomly generated number is less than `5.0`, the item becomes poison; otherwise, it becomes a sparkle.

### Audio
- **Background Music**: A **Mario soundtrack** plays throughout the entire game.
- Learned how to implement continuous sound within an IntelliJ project by referencing a **YouTube tutorial**.

### Handmade/Self-Drawn Graphics
- **Witch, Star, Poison, and Black Mushroom**: Custom illustrations added to the immersive atmosphere.

### Interactivity
- **Fairy Click**: Clicking on a fairy transforms it into a witch.
- **Tile Manipulation**: Surrounding 8 tiles turn to black mushrooms unless they contain another entity.

## Instructions

1. **Transforming a Fairy**  
   - Click on a **fairy** to convert it into a **witch**.
2. **Changing the Environment**  
   - Click on a **patch of grass** or **nearby entities** to modify terrain into barren land or produce additional black mushrooms.
3. **Observing Sparkles and Poisons**  
   - **Be patient** to see exponential spread. Sparkles and poisons may appear slowly, but will eventually propagate through the map.
4. **Waiting for Random Outcomes**  
   - **Sparkle vs. Poison** is randomly chosen when the Witch interacts with mushrooms or stumps.

## Conclusion

The **Sparkle Witch Game** combines interactive gameplay, random events, and entity-based design to create a lively simulation. From witches that enchant mushrooms at random to sparkles that proliferate across the board, each element demonstrates core **Java** programming principles in a fun and visually engaging environment. Audio integration and custom graphics further enhance the user experience, while the real-time transformation mechanics encourage experimentation and exploration.
