## Overview

Between **July 2022** and **September 2022**, I independently **designed**, **3D printed**, and **assembled** a custom robotic arm project. Built around three servo motors, this arm offers **three degrees of freedom**, enabling it to pick up, manipulate, and sort objects with precision. Programming was done in **C++** with a microcontroller (Arduino), showcasing a complete end-to-end design and build process—from CAD modeling to functional automation.

## Mechanical Design

### CAD Modeling
- **Onshape**: Used to create detailed 3D models of each arm component, ensuring an accurate and efficient design.
- **Iterative Prototyping**: Refined part geometries to balance **structural strength** and **range of motion**.

### 3D Printing
- **Custom Components**: Printed joints, brackets, and structural elements specifically tailored to the project’s dimensions.
- **Material Selection**: Chose filament (PLA or ABS, for example) based on durability and ease of printing.

### Assembly Process
- **Servo Integration**: Mounted three servo motors into the printed brackets, allowing each axis to move independently.
- **Joint Alignment**: Ensured smooth rotation and minimal friction with bearings, screws, and well-aligned pivots.

## Control and Programming

### Microcontroller (Arduino)
- **C++ Programming**: Wrote code to handle servo position control, calibration, and automated routines.
- **Servo Control**: Utilized Arduino libraries to command the motors.

### Automation and Object Manipulation
- **Object Sorting**: Programmed sequences to differentiate and place objects in designated areas.
- **Customizable Motions**: Routines could be adjusted or expanded for different tasks, showcasing adaptability.
